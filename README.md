## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Integration Fails to Load**
   - Ensure the `ctek_nanogrid_air` folder is in the correct location (`custom_components` directory).
   - Check for typos in the configuration settings (host, port, username, password).
   - Review the Home Assistant logs for errors (`Settings > System > Logs`).

2. **Using `curl` for Troubleshooting**
   If you're having trouble with the integration or sensors not updating, you can verify that the device is responding correctly by running the following `curl` command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   curl -u ctek:password http://your.ip.goes.here/status/

3. **"Offline" State for Sensors**
   - Verify that the CTEK device is online and accessible at the specified IP and port.
   - Check your network settings to ensure the Home Assistant instance can communicate with the device.
   - Ensure the username and password are correct for accessing the CTEK API.

3. **Error Logs**
   If you encounter issues, review the logs:
   - Go to **Settings > System > Logs**.
   - Look for entries related to `ctek_nanogrid_air` to identify the problem.

### Debugging
Enable debug logging for this integration to gather more information:
1. Add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.ctek_nanogrid_air: debug
